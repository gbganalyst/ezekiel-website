Two proportions (A/B test)\n\nYou test two website buttons.\n\n-   Group A: 45 conversions out of 300 (15 percent)\n-   Group B: 66 conversions out of 300 (22 percent)\n-   H₀: pA = pB\n-   H₁: pA ≠ pB\n-   Pooled proportion = 111/600 = 0.185\n-   Standard error ≈ 0.0317\n-   Difference = 0.22 − 0.15 = 0.07\n-   $z = 0.07/0.0317 ≈ 2.21$, two sided p ≈ 0.027\n-   Decision: p \\< 0.05, reject H₀.\n-   Interpretation: “Button B converts significantly better than A by about 7 percentage points.”\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Example 3. Paired test (before vs after)\n\nYou measure 12 students’ scores before and after a workshop and compute the differences.\n\n-   H₀: mean difference = 0\n-   H₁: mean difference \\> 0\n-   Use a **paired t test** on the differences.\n-   If p = 0.01, conclude: “The workshop increased scores on average.”\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Key ideas to remember\n\n-   **Type I error**: rejecting a true H₀.
