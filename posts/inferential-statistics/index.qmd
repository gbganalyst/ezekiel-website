**What is statistical hypothesis testing?**

It is a structured way to use data to decide between two competing claims about a population.

-   **Null hypothesis (H₀)**: the status quo or no effect.
-   **Alternative hypothesis (H₁)**: the new claim or an effect exists.
-   **Significance level (α)**: the mistake rate you accept for wrongly rejecting H₀, often 0.05.
-   **Test statistic and p value**: numbers computed from your sample that tell you how compatible the data are with H₀.

If the p value ≤ α, you reject H₀. If the p value \> α, you do not reject H₀. You do not “accept” H₀, you simply lack enough evidence against it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The workflow

1.  **State H₀ and H₁** clearly.
2.  **Choose a test and α** based on your question and data type.
3.  **Collect data** and check assumptions.
4.  **Compute the test statistic and p value**.
5.  **Decide**: compare p to α.
6.  **Report** the result with plain language, the estimate, a confidence interval, and the effect size if possible.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Example 1. One sample mean

A factory claims the mean fill is 50 cl.

-   H₀: μ = 50 cl
-   H₁: μ ≠ 50 cl
-   Sample: n = 36 bottles, mean = 53 cl, sd = 12 cl, α = 0.05
-   Test (approximately z or one sample t): $z = \frac{53-50}{12/\sqrt{36}} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5$ Two sided p value ≈ 0.13
-   Decision: p \> 0.05, do not reject H₀.
-   Teacher’s wording: “With this sample we do not have enough evidence that the true mean differs from 50 cl.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Example 2. Two proportions (A/B test)

You test two website buttons.

-   Group A: 45 conversions out of 300 (15 percent)
-   Group B: 66 conversions out of 300 (22 percent)
-   H₀: pA = pB
-   H₁: pA ≠ pB
-   Pooled proportion = 111/600 = 0.185
-   Standard error ≈ 0.0317
-   Difference = 0.22 − 0.15 = 0.07
-   $z = 0.07/0.0317 ≈ 2.21$, two sided p ≈ 0.027
-   Decision: p \< 0.05, reject H₀.
-   Interpretation: “Button B converts significantly better than A by about 7 percentage points.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Example 3. Paired test (before vs after)

You measure 12 students’ scores before and after a workshop and compute the differences.

-   H₀: mean difference = 0
-   H₁: mean difference \> 0
-   Use a **paired t test** on the differences.
-   If p = 0.01, conclude: “The workshop increased scores on average.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key ideas to remember

-   **Type I error**: rejecting a true H₀. Rate is α.
-   **Type II error**: not rejecting a false H₀. Its complement is **power**.
-   **Statistical significance is not practical importance**. Always report the estimated effect and a confidence interval.
-   Choose the test to match your data: means (t tests, ANOVA), proportions (z test or chi square), counts in tables (chi square or Fisher), relationships (correlation or regression).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## A short reporting template

“Using a two sided t test, the mean score was higher in the treatment group than the control group by 4.2 points, 95 percent CI 1.1 to 7.3, t(58) = 2.70, p = 0.009. This suggests a meaningful improvement.”

## Quick practice prompts

1.  A coin is flipped 100 times and lands heads 62 times. Test if the coin is fair.
2.  A new drug aims to reduce average blood pressure by 5 mmHg. Test the claim using a sample of 40 patients.
3.  Two ads get click rates of 8 percent and 11 percent on equal samples of 500 views. Test if the rates differ.
